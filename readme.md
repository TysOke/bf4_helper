## Battlefield4 Helper

### Prelude

I wrote bf4_helper to make managing my loadouts easier.

Everyone has different tastes when it comes to loadouts, but unlocks are not as obvious as they could be.

They do exist in some places, but I wanted something that would keep me going for unlocks. There are times when I play a game and don't know what I should be doing. I want a helper to make sure that is always obvious to me.

For now (January 2014), bf4_helper focuses on weapon loadouts, but I'll try to make sure it includes vehicles, classes, achievements, assignments, and more.
